PHP Login System

PHP Login System is a user authentication framework built with PHP, enabling secure login and registration functionality. It typically includes features like user input validation, password hashing (using tools like bcrypt), session management for user authentication, and optional features such as email verification and account recovery. This system is designed to protect user credentials and manage access to restricted areas of a website or application.

PHP Login System is a secure mechanism that allows users to authenticate by entering a username and password. It typically involves:

1. User Registration: 
   - Users provide details like username, email, and password.
   - Passwords are hashed (using algorithms like bcrypt) before storing them in a database.

2. Login: 
   - Users input their credentials, which are validated against the stored database records.
   - If valid, a session or token is created to maintain the user's logged-in state.

3. Session Management: 
   - Use PHP sessions to track user authentication.
   - Protect sensitive pages by checking if a session exists.

4. Logout: 
   - Destroy the session to log out the user securely.

5. Additional Features:
   - Password recovery/reset.
   - Input validation to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks.

Key Technologies: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and  frameworks like Bootstrap for styling or libraries like jQuery for enhanced interactivity.
